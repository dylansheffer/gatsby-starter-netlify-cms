In the landscape of client-side JavaScript frameworks, there are a lot to choose from! Many of them are a "one-size fits all" approach to building applications. Vue.js offers a refreshing new point of "view" that gives your team the flexibility to build web applications the way they want to, not how a framework wants them too.



In this course, students will spend time learning the basics of Vue.JS and how to design a robust client-side application around it.
