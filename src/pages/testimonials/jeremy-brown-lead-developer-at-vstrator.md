Hiring \[Swift Kick] was one of the best decisions we ever made. When we needed extra help to implement a new feature for our web solution to compliment a recent release of our mobile app \[Swift Kick] charged in and delivered. \[They] not only helped with the feature, but offered guidance on our current efforts to implement several client-side frameworks. \[They] also played a key role in helping us developing future architecture to handle synchronization and notifications between our mobile and web applications. When you outsource development it is very refreshing to go from having to spend hours documenting every little detail to "Hey \[Swift Kick] we need thisâ€¦" and it getting done and done right.
